<p>I’m so excited that you have an interest in placing your faith in Jesus. I don’t know you personally, but God does and I believe He’s been pursuing you. And whatever it is that has led you to this decision, I don’t think it’s an accident.</p>

<blockquote>From one man he made all the nations, that they should inhabit the whole earth; and he marked out their appointed times in history and the boundaries of their lands. God did this so that they would seek him and perhaps reach out for him and find him, though he is not far from any one of us.
Acts 17:26-27</blockquote>

You are known by God and you can know God. Our sin is what has separated us from God. But Jesus Christ died on a cross to pay for or to cover all of our sins. He took on our sin, so that we could take on his righteousness. He did this because He loves you that much. He wanted you to be part of God’s family, to become a son or a daughter of God.

We have sinned. God sent Jesus to pay the price for our sins, so that we could receive forgiveness. Jesus has done his part. Your part is to place your faith in Him. You can pray a prayer of faith right now. “Jesus, thank you for dying for my sins and bringing me into a personal relationship with you. I place my faith in You as my Lord and Savior. May I follow you wherever you lead me.”

<blockquote>Yet to all who did receive him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God
John 1:12</blockquote>

At TAF, we are passionate about helping you follow Jesus. The best way we can do this is for someone on our team to meet with you, hear your story, answer any questions, provide resources, and direct you towards your next steps in your faith journey. Email Will@epicsf.com. Again, I am so excited about what’s ahead for you.

If you’ve got a few more minutes, watch this great video from The Bible Project which traces the theme of God’s “covering” over human evil through animal sacrifices that ultimately point to Jesus and his death and resurrection.
