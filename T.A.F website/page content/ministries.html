      <h3>Kids</h3>
      <p>Epic Kids is a fun, safe environment geared for children to learn more about God and His purpose for their lives. Through Epic Kids we seek to partner with parents as their child is learning what it means to be a part of God's "big family." Every Sunday we provide care and classes for babies, toddlers, and elementary aged kids during both of our services (9:30am and 11:00am). Below is the breakdown of our five rooms:</p>
      <ul class="epic-list kids-ministries">
        <li>0 to 18 months</li>
        <li>18 months to 3 years old</li>
        <li>Preschool - 3 to 5 years old</li>
        <li>Kindergarten to 2nd grade</li>
        <li>3rd grade to 5th grade</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Students</h3>
      <p>Every Sunday during our 11:00am service we have a dedicated teaching environment for 6th-8th grade students. Each week, students experience a combination of games, teaching, and interaction with a dedicated small group of peers.</p>

      <h3>Parents</h3>
      <p>Every family needs support. Whether it's a single-parent home, or mom and dad are engaged daily with the kids, every family can use resources and encouragement to help them with the upbringing of their children. Epic's Family Ministry seeks to provide parents with useful tools and supportive environments that will help them raise their kids in a God-honoring way.</p>
