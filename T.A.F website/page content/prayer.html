<h3>Begin the practice of prayer!</h3>

Prayer establishes a life changing relationship allowing you to bring your most heartfelt needs to a God who genuinely cares for you. Simply start with an honest conversation and listen to Him as He guides you.

<h4>Praying</h4>

<b>Why should you pray?</b>

The best way to build a relationship with someone is to spend time talking to the other person. The same thing is true within your relationship with God. Just as reading your Bible helps you know God more intimately, so does spending time with him in prayer.

<b>Tips for a strong prayer life:</b>

Set aside time every day for prayer. Don’t be tempted to push your conversations with God into the leftover pieces of your busy day.

Make prayer a priority. Combining your prayer time and your Bible reading time into a morning devotional is a great idea.

Don’t role play for God. Just be yourself and talk to Him. You don’t have to use fancy words and you don’t have to try and impress Him. Just come to God as simply and honestly as you can. Speak from your heart. He is your father.

<blockquote>I will give them hearts that recognize me as the Lord. They will be my people, and I will be their God, for they will return to me wholeheartedly.
Jeremiah 24:7</blockquote>

<b>How should you pray?</b>

Spend some time praising and thanking God for the good things in your life.

Confess any sins that you have committed or sinful habits you’re struggling with.

Tell God what is worrying you and what you need help with.

Pray that God will guide and direct your life. Spend time praying for others as you become aware of their needs and desires.

Remember, prayer is a conversation, not a monologue. As you develop your prayer life, you will get more comfortable both speaking to and hearing from God. Ask Him to reveal himself to you.
