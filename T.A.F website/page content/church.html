<h3>Begin reading the Bible!</h3>

God wants you to get to know Him. One of the primary ways that we come to know Him and that He speaks to us is through the Bible. Start reading in the book of John, as it’s a great place to learn about the life of Christ and His message.

<h4>The Bible</h4>

The Bible is a collection of sixty-six books written by about forty authors, in three different languages, on three different continents, over approximately 1600 years.

God communicates with us through the Bible. There are several practices that can actively make that communication with God a daily part of your experience with Him.

Here are 5 primary ways to integrate the Bible into your life:

<ol>
<li><b>Hear</b>: We can hear from God as we listen to biblical teaching; both through Epic and other resources you can find.</li>
<li><b>Read</b>: You will get to know God by spending time reading His Word. Set a goal to read the Bible for at least fifteen minutes every day.</li>
<li><b>Study</b>: Study the truths you read. As you dig into the Bible, ask yourself these questions: What does God promise? What example is there to follow? What command is there to obey? What sin is there to confess?</li>
<li><b>Memorize</b>: God wants us to hold scripture close to our heart and to be able to call on it when it is needed. This ability comes as we memorize verses that speak to us.</li>
<li><b>Meditate</b>: This ties in with memorizing. After you memorize a verse, spend some time meditating on it. Analyze and dwell on its truth as you go about your day.</li>
</ol>

The Bible is useful and helpful in all situations. Here is a powerful verse from the book of Hebrews reminding us of this truth:

<blockquote>For the word of God is living and active, sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and of spirit, of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
Hebrews 4:12</blockquote>

Another verse from the Bible that tells us that we can trust it and use it for our own good:

<blockquote>All Scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness...
2 Timothy 3:16</blockquote>

There are a number of good translations of the Bible. At Epic we primarily use the New International Version (NIV).

As you take the step to integrate the Bible into your daily life, you will see how it is relevant to everything that you face. God will use your time in the Bible to teach you about His truths and draw you closer to Him.
