    <h3>Teens Aloud Foundation Leadership(2022/2023)
    </h3>

    <p>Teens Aloud Foundation leaders comprises of a group of well bible rooted people who have one common goal of 
        winning more to christ as it is out the mission that we were given by our Saviour Jesus Christ as written <b>Mathew 28:18-20</b> </p>

    <p>More importantly, by serving in a TAF leadership team, we follow Jesus' lead to serve. Jesus came to serve (Mark 10:45), and as we serve one another, we use our unique gifts to play a proactive part in our church fellowship, the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:18-27).</p>
