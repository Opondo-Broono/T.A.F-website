<h3>Get baptized!</h3>

Baptism is an important next step after we have put our faith in Jesus. It is an outward expression of the inward reality.

Watch this short video from Pastor KK Baido about the meaning of baptism.

<h4>Baptism</h4>

<b>What is baptism?</b>

Baptism does not make you a Christian. It is a step of obedience once you have placed your faith in Jesus for salvation. Baptism is a visual and symbolic demonstration of a person’s union with Christ in the likeness of His death and resurrection. Baptism is perhaps the greatest way Christians have identified with Jesus throughout history.

<blockquote>So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls.
Acts 2:41</blockquote>

<blockquote>But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
Acts 8:12</blockquote>

We do not baptize infants at Epic Church. While we do family dedications (asking God to bless the child and the parents of the child), we believe that baptism follows a person’s decision to become a Christian.

<b>Why should we be baptized?</b>

Jesus Himself was baptized. (Matthew 3:16)

Jesus commanded that we be baptized. (Matthew 28:19-20)

It shows externally that we’ve been changed on the inside.

<b>Do you need to be baptized?</b>
