    <h3>In the Church</h3>

    <p>Without volunteers, the very things we enjoy on Sundays at Epic - coffee, music, lights, words to our favorite songs, programming for our kids - would not exist.
Needless to say, volunteers are highly valued here!</p>

    <p>More importantly, by serving in a volunteer team, we follow Jesus' lead to serve. Jesus came to serve (Mark 10:45), and as we serve one another, we use our unique gifts to play a proactive part in our church, the body of Christ (1 Corinthians 12:18-27).</p>
